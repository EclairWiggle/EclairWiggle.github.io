### How do you get people together?

> Give a man a fire and he's warm for the day. But set fire to him and he's warm for the rest of his life.

Imagine for a moment, a group of people that have only just met... run across each other's paths with no purpose, just accidentally bumped into them. Imagine also, that rather than emulating bumper cars at a carnival... spinning away as soon as they are approached by anything, these people prefer to stay close and enjoy the moment of companionship. Then, how does one create an atmosphere of acceptance, enjoyment, and comraderie? There are many answers of course, but I prefer to think that there is a best answer. That answer, for me, is a bonfire. 

Whether it's because we're destructive creatures or because we're enamoured with an element that we can control but also possesses an innate danger, humans seem to love fires. Once a group has gathered and the sun starts heading for the horizon, it's an easy suggestion to head out to the fire pit, enjoying the crackle of the burning wood... while also noticing nature going to sleep around you. It's a beautiful thing. 

Having an opportunity to observe a group in this situation just this weekend, I was struck by how much people seem to open up around a fire. Even people who are reticent to share in the social dynamic leading up to the event, seem to relax around a fire and let themselves enjoy the people around them. In the semi-dark, people feel less judged, I would posit... allowing themselves and their emotions to be slightly hid by the ever-moving shadows cast by the flame. Also, it brings us back to our roots. We feel a connection with fire in a way that can only be partially explained by the reliance that we had upon it for so long. It is warmth, it is life in so many ways, and huddled together around it, people can't help but be moved by its comfort. 

Long story short, I would encourage you... if you haven't recently (or really even if you have)... to get outside, start a fire, and enjoy the smell of smoke, the sounds of the flames, and the enjoyment of a social setting that is created for the equalization and safety of humanity. It's a perfect time of year for it in the Northern hemisphere, as the reaches of winter is pushed back north, the cool crisp spring days lead into perfect bonfire evenings. 
#### Cheers!
