### Alternatively, The Comeback!

I play as Pawnunition on Lichess.org where I play mainly 10+0 rapid games. Of course, I play all my moves in under 5 minutes most of the time, so I should really be playing 5+0 games, but I like the 'option' to have more time to think about it. Recently, I played a person named Raynax. In the first game, they beat me at least partially due to a misclick on my part where I moved a rook slightly to the right, leaving a giant open hole in my defense, which resulted in said rook dying for a bishop. It was a bad move on my part, and I knew that, but sometimes when playing online, you misclick and move things in ways that make no sense. But either way, the game that I'm interested in talking about is Game 2, the rematch that I requested. 

First of all, you can view the whole game [here](https://lichess.org/6scBrnBSTy71). But either way, into the analysis!

1. e4 e5
2. Nf3 Nc6

There's not much to say about this, I opened typically for white with e4 into Nf3 so that I could threaten the center structure. The engine at this point always says that you should follow up with Bb5 to trade out the knight, create a stacked pawn structure and unprotect the black pawn on e5. I just don't like doing the early trades, because then I have alot more pieces for tricks later. I will say though, that due to the fact that I rarely actually success with my early game, perhaps I should do the trades and hope for some neat tactics with the fewer pieces in the mid-game. 

3. c3 a6

I'm assuming that black's move to a6 was to protect from Bb5, which I still had no intention of playing, but it's not a bad defensive move. The major downside to playing this, in my opinion, is that you're doing more pawn moves and not developing your pieces. By playing c3, I'm setting up for d4 to threaten and break the center, so I'm confused why a6 was the response. I will say though, that on the other hand, protecting that knight on c6, which is a  key defensive piece at the moment, is okay... just not ideal. 

4. d4 exd4
5. cxd4 d5

The center pawn exchange happened much like you'd expect and white came out pretty far ahead in terms of center strength/control. At this point, the engine says that the best move in exd5 which threatens the knight slightly and erradicates the center black pawns entirely. I don't like this move because again... it's just an early trade for no positional advantage. Of course, it does make the black queen come out early, where she might be more vulnerable, but it's hard to take advantage of this in my opinion and doesn't make up for the fact that the center squares are no longer fully controlled by a strong pawn position. 

6. e5 f6
7. Bd3 fxe5
8. dxe5 Bb4+
9. Bd2 Bxd2+
10. Nbxd2 Nb4

Black traded out another pawn to weaken the center, which I think was a very wise decision as a strong pawn structure that far over the middle of the board is a pain to deal with. Then, pushing a bishop out to create a check just to put out some pressure, I traded out the dark square bishops. The engine disagreed with my move, by the way, and suggested that I not trade there... but it simplifies the position. Again deciding to bring out more minor pieces rather than moving my queen, I brought the knight out to take the trade. And in this position, I made a fairly large blunder. Once black's knight came forward, it would have been a simple win to move Qa4+ putting the black king in check and forcing the knight to back up or get taken. It would have at the very least, won more tempo, but I didn't see it and play proceeded with that knight not being forced back for the time being. 

11. Nb3 Nxd3+
12. Qxd3 Bg4
13. O-O Bxf3
14. Qxf3 Qe7

The black player clearly prefers simplified mid-games and is trading quickly and significantly. As long as the trades aren't weakening my position, I don't mind terribly at this point, because I feel confident in my center position. In move 14, the black player finally decides that I've been in the center long enough. Now, by move 14, the only minor pieces still left are a single knight for each side, the center is partially blocked by an extended and passed white pawn, and white has successfully castled, moving the king into a very strong defensive position on king side. The black king is still out in the middle of the board and can't castle king side for a while to a still undeveloped knight and the white queen sitting on the f file. Stockfish is saying that white's position is significantly leading, but there's still plenty of moves left in the game.

15. Rfe1 O-O-O
16. Rad1 b6

I did not see the castle queenside coming and it threw me off for a second. I actually paused at this point, to give it some thought. I don't see queenside castling often in my games and so the position takes a second. Black also has quite a few pawns left on that side, so it will be up to me to figure out how to break the defense. Point of note, both white rooks are in play, and on powerful squares, while one of black's rooks is still trapped in the corner by a knight that still has yet to move. 

17. Rxd5 Rxd5
18. Qxd5 c5

A rook trade, the first trade that white has actually initiated. I was finally feeling confident enough in my lead, both positionally and materally, to start trading off a bit more. Plus, with that rook gone, there was only one powerful piece to be concerned about in the black queen. White fully controls the center with the black queen being stuck on defensive duty so that the pawn doesn't promote. The next move the engine suggest is Qa8+ to check and then pin the knight onto the rook, basically leaving the corner pieces stuck there for even longer. I opted for a different tack, prefering to push up through the center farther and pressure the queen. I was also hoping that he'd move the knight so that when I did Qa8+ it would gain me the rook. I have a tendency to play hoping that my opponents make a mistake rather than creating an opening for myself, which is definitely something that I'm working on. 

19. e6 Nf6
20. Qa8+ Kc7
21. Qxh8 Nd5

I got the knight move that I wanted while still pushing the center forward and won the rook for nothing. At this point, the game is basically won as long as white doesn't make a huge blunder, but the black knight still represents a threat and the white knight is very far away from the action and with all of blacks queenside pawns in place, it will be awkward to work the knight into the fight. 

22. Qxh7 Nf4
23. Qe4 Nxg2

The white queen probably should have moved back to a8 which is a stronger position, but I decided against it in favor of taking more pawns and further weakening the possibility of pawn pushes against the side that my king was hiding. With Nxg2, I feel that black was giving up. It was clearly throwing away the knight for almost no point other than to slightly weaken the white king's defense. However, there was no momentum on the part of black and this move gained nothing. It's also interesting to note that 23 moves into this game, the e pawn for white is still alive and is a anchor point for white's center control/attack.

24. Qxg2 g5
25. Nd2 a5
26. Nf3 b5
27. Nxg5 c4

White has completely eradicated the right side of the board of pawns and gotten the white knight into a position where it will be useful in the coming storm. The black pawn wall has started marching on the white queenside, but it's more of a last ditch attempt than anything particularly scary. Black is attempting to keep all the pawns together to protect each other. The only real concern here is if I get distracted by the advance and don't push my advantage, so I ignore them entirely and begin the final attack. 

28. Nf7 b4
29. Qh3 a4
30. Rd1 Kc6
31. Ne5+ Kc5
32. Qe3+ Kb5

All of white's pieces are now attacking the king, using that center e pawn as an anchor for the attack. I did miss a neat fork trade to get rid of black queen by moving Rd7 at some point while the black king was on the 7th row, but it was not really in my mind. I saw the move at one point, but preferred to just keep pushing the king around and avoiding dealing with the black queen entirely. The other thing that I found interesting is the black pawns... they are in a really good place, pressuring the queenside of white really well. If the game was in a different position or even if the black king was better protected, this would be a scary thing to deal with. 

33. Rd5+ Ka6
34. Nc6 Qxe6
35. Qxe6 c3
36. Nxb4+ Kb7
37. Qc6+ Kb8 
38. Rb5+ Ka7
39. Qa6#

The end of the game was basically a flurry of checks (only two of the last nine moves for white were NOT checks), moving the king around until I found the right position to finish the game out with a mate. The pawn on e didn't quite live through to the end, but it was useful to remove the black queen, a valid achievement for a pawn I think. The black c pawn is only two squares from promotion, so if there was just a bit better tempo on the side of black, this might have gone a very different way. The final time was 6:09 left for black and 6:31 for white, which means that the entire game was played in less than five minutes for each side. I need to spend more time thinking most likely, but I was happy with this win. I liked the story of Edgar, our faithful e pawn, and thought that the analysis might be interesting. 

Hope that you enjoyed it and I may do more of these in the future as I do play quite a few games of chess these days, especially with all the hype around the Candidates tournament going on right now. Thanks for reading!

#### Cheers!
