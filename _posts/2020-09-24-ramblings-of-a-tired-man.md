### Or... Where I Find A Path Through

It's been a while since I've written anything. I've been trying to find the mental energy to push myself to write lately, but it's been a struggle. After seeing an Imgur post that was shared to me a few days ago, I've realized that I may not be alone in this feeling, so I thought I should probably attempt to push forward and see about writing again. 

The biggest takeaway from this whole year so far is how tired I've been. It's partly because I haven't been sleeping in the same way and I don't tend to go to bed when I should, but also just because the emotional and mental strain of constantly living in a world where people are torn apart is tragically overwhelming. I probably won't focus on this too much, because even as I mention it, I feel the life draining away from me slightly. 

So, I'm trying to find things in my life to make myself happy again... push through the murky waters in my head to find something to focus on and enjoy. Of course, there has been much positive this year as well.. I've switched jobs, bought a house, made new friends, kept old ones, etc etc. It's not been an all-bad year and I think we tend to forget that. 

So from now on, I'm going to take a renewed attempt at trying to remain positive. There are plenty of things that are terrible, horrible things, but I want to try and focus on the things that are positive in my life. Thus, I've taken some steps... for example, I've basically removed social media from my life. The one huge exception is, of course, Reddit... and I still spend a decent amount of time on there, but I've focused my sub list to things that focus on positivity or interest or learning. Even gaming subreddits that tend to have a lot of whining and frustration, I've removed for the purpose of keeping my mental plate a bit more empty.

I encourage you to find a way to focus on positivity, remove the extraneous elements from your life and find a more peaceful existence. We need to find what makes us happy... truly happy... and not what just makes us be able to get through the day. Plain existence is a goal that we should all hopefully meet, but we can do so much more than that!

So... moving forward, I want to write again, I want to enjoy again, read again... and smile again. Join me on the journey and hopefully your creative project can get off the ground again too!

#### Cheers!
