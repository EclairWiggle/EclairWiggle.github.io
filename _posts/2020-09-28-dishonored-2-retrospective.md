### Dishonored 2 Retrospective

So about this time, you have to ask yourself... does EclairWiggle only play games that are open world even though they insist that they don't particularly like open world games? Well... the answer is no, but it does seem like there are so many games out there that follow this same sort of philosophy. I will say though, that while this game offers lots of exploration and collection options, it's not really an open world game in a real way. So let's dig in!

Firstly, we'll talk about the story. I played through the game as Emily (I guess that's a slight spoiler, I'm going to avoid them through this post) and because I'm terrible at stealth, I ended up having a 'high chaos' run, which just means that every time that I got spotted, I murdered everything. This resulted in an ending which was a very large letdown in my opinion, especially since I accidentally killed a few people that I really didn't mean to (I know, I know... I shouldn't have 'accidentally' killed anyone and there's a quick save/quick load option... but frankly, I just was very done with the game by the time that I made some of these decisions). It wasn't a bad story and the dark magic themes were interesting, I enjoy diving into the Outsider a bit more, so that was neat, but overall it was a very lackluster ending that left me very unsatisfied.

As far as the collection thing goes, it was good about making sure that you knew that you were supposed to collect something in the area that you were in. I just... didn't want to be bothered most of the time. There were a few times that I used the heart to find out a new rune or whatever, but mostly, I noticed that they were pretty far away and in the opposite direction of the story, and just skipped them. It made collecting easy and I still didn't do it, which is probably kinda sad. As such, I was playing through the game with a very low amount of abilities, compared to someone that would have had more to play with if they were more of a collector. I also probably missed out on a lot of the 'mission hints' that would have given me more options in terms of how I finished the missions.

Gameplay and mechanics wise... this game was stellar in its movement and spells. I loved teleporting all over the place, finding ways around things based on the fact that I could teleport somewhere and then jump down from high heights. There was some awesome stuff as far as that was concerned and some of the kills that I did were very fun because of that. 

However, where the gameplay sort of fell apart was any time that you were in combat. Granted, you're not really 'supposed' to be in combat during this game, since it encourages you to stealth through the whole thing, but I really disliked the sword play. Assassinations on unsuspecting targets was amazing but when you were fighting someone that knew you were there... it was just very ... meh. 

Also, as a side note on enemies... those clockwork soldiers can just... not be there. I skipped fighting all of them and just ended up dashing through areas that I triggered them in, because they were a pain in the neck and I never found a good way to fight them. That could have been on me, or an ability that I never got around to unlocking, but generally I just ran away from them. One of them, I even shot in the head like... five times until it couldn't see and then just dodged around it and carried out my mission, leaving it wandering around complaining in its robotic voice 'can't find target' or whatever. In retrospect, it was kinda sad... like a lost doll or something. Hmm... weird thoughts. 

I am glad that I finished this game as it has been sitting on my hard drive for a long time, but I'm also glad that it's over. It wasn't my thing, didn't like it as much as the first and I'm glad that I can check it off the list, uninstall it, and move on to the next thing! I think the next game that I'm going to focus on beating is Dawn of War 1: Winter Assault, so look forward to a retrospective on that in the coming days!

#### Cheers!
