(This is a copy/paste from the Hello World post! Low effort 'about' page for the win!)

Hello, I’m the author of ./EclairWiggle … a blog about random things that I find interesting as I live my life. Before we start posting real content to this blog, I thought it might be interesting to hear a little bit about the history of ./EclairWiggle and why it’s being written in the first place.

I have been looking for some time for a creative venture, something that would allow me to share thoughts and ideas and feelings and whatever comes to mind without becoming an all-consuming vehicle of my own destruction. That said, I’ve lit upon the idea of creating a blog. As I’ve told people in my life before, I’ve always thought that there was a part of me that wanted to hang out in coffee shops on a laptop pulled from a messenger bag and type out ideas and thoughts on my blog. Of course, in my head, this is happening somewhere grey and rainy like Seattle… but doing it from the Crossroads of the Midwest will have to do for now!

Anyways, I set out to attempt to find the perfect website to host my new creative venture. Of course, the second most important part of a creative venture is figuring out where it’s supposed to live (the first most important part is just starting it, in case you were unaware). I spent many hours combing over the internet, trying to decide if I wanted a Wordpress blog or a Blogger blog or some other overly complicated software that would do all the hard work for me. That’s when I happened upon Jekyll. This piece of technology would allow me to make static pages and utilize the semi-powerful Markdown language all from a Github page??? Well, it was an easy sell… as I like slim simple pages and uncomplicated tech stacks… and free Github hosting. So here we are… after spending several hours tweaking themes/colors, I have come up with a design that I like for the time being and will make me happy. Will it get changed? It’s hard to say, but I will say that I’m open to the idea of it evolving!

As to the interesting question of what will show up on this blog? Well, I am a varied person of varied interests and I think that this space will probably reflect that pretty much. So, I will be writing about whatever floats my boat that day. If I had to give a summary now (which seems unfair since you’re not supposed to write the summary before you write the content), I would say that it will feature elements of technology (I’m a software engineer by day), philosophy, mathematics, chess, art, literature, poetry, games, and many more things… most likely of the nerdy variety. If that sounds interesting to you, feel free to stick around! Hopefully if one day doesn’t interest you as much, then the next day will be back on track to be your favorite topic ever!

Thanks for hanging out with me as I wander upon this creative venture and I look forward to sharing many thoughts and experiences with you all!
